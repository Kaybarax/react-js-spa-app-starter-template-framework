              <strong>App working data and main components state/data (the stores):</strong><br/>
              All app working data, and main components state is managed in your "stores."<br/>
              So, you have a main store <em>"app"</em> which, specifically, is for managing <em>running
              app</em> data.<br/>
              Then you have other stores based on, and for your app's main components, in this
              showcase,&nbsp;
              that would be the components [page1, page2, page3, page4]. Those stores essential hold the
              component's&nbsp;
              state globally, such that their information can be shared across each other.<br/>

              The stores mini-ecosystem within the the design is setup in its directory across multiple
              files&nbsp;
              that are very much self explanatory to their roles. As you use this design system, just go
              with&nbsp;
              the flow there to extend (especially for "app" store) and add your own new stores for&nbsp;
              your app's components; and if you feel you can and want to improve on their design, of course,
              sure you can.<br/>
              The stores are persisted to localStorage so that you don't lose your working data across
              page reloads.
              <br/><br/>

              <strong>Controllers functions:</strong><br/>
              The first Javascript framework I worked with was AngularJs. That very first iteration of
              Angular.<br/>
              And that's where I really got introduced to the MVC design pattern, hands on, after a
              partial introduction in&nbsp;
              Java's Swing. React is a view library and not a full blown framework like Angular. But I am
              sure like most&nbsp;
              engineers, we like the practice of splitting things apart and dealing with them in pieces.
              So, let's&nbsp;
              have React components' classes or functions only deal with mostly the UI rendering, while
              any and most&nbsp;
              of functions that, that component/activity relies on be lifted out to a "controller" file
              for that&nbsp;
              activity, and you can just import and use as you wish.<br/>
              Just like the stores, the "controllers" are wrapped in their own directory for clean
              architecture&nbsp;
              encapsulation of bits and pieces.
              <br/><br/>

              <strong>Routing and navigation:</strong><br/>
              Again, React being a view library, well, no router and navigation pattern inherently
              included, and&nbsp;
              so it's up to the developer to pick and choose what they fancy. So I have picked a router
              that I&nbsp;
              found fitting from experience with it, for this template framework design around React.
              Details on&nbsp;
              this choice of router, and other parts of the system, in the next example page.<br/>
              And so with the selected router, I built around it a navigation and routing logic that so
              far,&nbsp;
              so good, I can smile about, and I find serving the whole system design, pretty well.<br/>
              Routing and navigation logic setup is wrapped up in its own
              "routing-and-navigation"&nbsp;
              directory. Follow the pattern therein, to add your own new routes and navigation
              functionality&nbsp;
              for your app.
              <br/><br/>

              So the above are the major parts of the system that needed a special mention. The rest are
              rather&nbsp;
              self explanatory from glance, container directory naming, and directory
              included <em>"ABOUT.md"</em><br/>

              Next up, what's in the box! What are bits and pieces that glue together, and power up this SPA
              starter&nbsp;
              template framework design???<br/><br/>

              <a href={PAGE3EXAMPLE_VIEW_ROUTE.routeName} onClick={e => _continueToPage3(e)}>
                Continue to Page 3 Example...
              </a>
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

      </SafeComponentWrapper>
  );

}

export default WithStoresHoc(Page2Example, ['page2ExampleStore', 'appStore']);
